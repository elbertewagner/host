      "description": " Remember where items are placed  As you pick up and throw down items, it’s easy to lose track of where everything is. Fortunately, items in Granny do not reset, even if you’re caught by granny and sent back to bed for the rest of the day.  The screwdriver is an important exception. It’s always on the shelf in the entrance. You will need to shoot it down with the crossbow or the shotgun to retrieve it.  Remembering where each item is located will prevent you from unnecessary backtracking and frustration. The best way to handle this is to throw items where they can easily be found — preferably right in front of the heavily secured front door.  Since it’s right in the middle of the house, it’s easy to fling items into the foyer. From the third floor, you can chuck items into the hole in the middle of the floor (the part that falls through) and they’ll land safely in the entrance. From the second floor, just throw them off the railing."

      "description": "Grab the pliers early  Most of the items in Granny have a single use, but not the pliers. They’re useful in three different parts of the house. Consider yourself lucky if you manage to find them early.  Here’s a list of what the pliers are for:      Cut the circuit box in the basement, unlocking one of the locks on the front door     Disable the alarm on the door     Turn off the fan upstairs, giving access to a key item  Once those tasks are complete, you can safely chuck the pliers and move on.

      "description": "The free-to-play horror game Granny has been out for a while now on Android and iOS, but thanks to frequent updates from creator DVloper, it’s managed to stay relevant more than six months after its release. For such a simple game, that’s no small feat.  Beating Granny is actually challenging. Without a beginner’s guide, new players are unlikely to make it further than the starting room without being clubbed by their dear grandmother.  To help, we’ve put together this list of tips & tricks for the popular Granny horror game. This guide does not spoil the ending, so don’t worry about ruining any surprises the game has to offer. "
